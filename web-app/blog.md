In this technical blog, we will walk through the steps to create a task scheduling app using React and Node.js. We will also cover how to build notifications using Flasho for the app.

Prerequisites
Before we get started, you will need to have some basic knowledge of React and Node.js. You will also need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

Step 1: Setting up the project
The first step is to set up the project. Create a new directory for the project and navigate to it using the terminal. Then, run the following command:

lua
Copy code
npx create-react-app task-scheduler
This will create a new React project in a directory called "task-scheduler". Navigate to this directory by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
cd task-scheduler
Next, we need to set up the server. Create a new file in the project directory called "server.js". Add the following code to the file:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
const port = 5000;

app.use(bodyParser.json());

let tasks = [];

app.post('/api/tasks', (req, res) => {
  tasks.push(req.body);
  res.send('Task added successfully!');
});

app.get('/api/tasks', (req, res) => {
  res.send(tasks);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
This code sets up a simple Express server that listens on port 5000 and has two endpoints - "/api/tasks" for adding tasks and "/api/tasks" for retrieving tasks.

Step 2: Creating the task scheduler app
Now that we have set up the client and the server, we can create the task scheduler app. In the "src" directory of the React project, create a new file called "api.js". Add the following code to the file:

javascript
Copy code
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:5000/api',
});

export const addTask = (task) => api.post('/tasks', task);

export const getTasks = () => api.get('/tasks');
This code sets up an Axios instance that is configured to send requests to the server running on port 5000. It also defines two functions - "addTask" for adding a task and "getTasks" for retrieving tasks.

Now we need to create a React component for displaying and adding tasks. Create a new file in the "src" directory called "TaskScheduler.js". Add the following code to the file:

javascript
Copy code
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { addTask, getTasks } from './api';

function TaskScheduler() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
  const [newTask, setNewTask] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    getTasks()
      .then((response) => {
        setTasks(response.data);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
      });
  }, []);

  const handleNewTask = (event) => {
    setNewTask(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleAddTask = () => {
    addTask({ task: newTask })
      .then((response) => {
        console.log(response.data);
        setTasks([...tasks, { task: newTask }]);
        setNewTask('');
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
      });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Task Scheduler</h1>
      <ul>
        {tasks.map((task, index) => (
          <li key={
